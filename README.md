# Note-Aggregator
Uses the information on the clipboard and counts the amount of times the information is repeated

### Ignore List
This will generate a file named ingnoreList.txt, anything put in there will be ignored when counting

Example -
"Comment States: No information availible"
"No information availible"

When "Comment States: " is added to the ignore list -

"No information availible"
"No information availible"

The code would count those to items as the same and output as such
